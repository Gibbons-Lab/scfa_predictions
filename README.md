# Prediction of Short-Chain Fatty Acid Production from the Human Gut Microbiome
In this respository, find all analyses for the manuscript "Microbial community-scale metabolic modeling predicts personalized short-chain-fatty-acid production profiles in the human gut", Bohmann et al. 

In the notebooks directory, all Jupyter notebooks for all analyses can be found. invitro.ipynb details the construction and simulation of in vitro samples from Clark et al. 2021. study_a.ipynb, study_b.ipynb, and study_c.ipynb contian analysis of ex vivo studies A, B and C. fiber_study.ipynb contains analysis for modeling of samples from Wastyk et al. 2021. arivale.ipynb contians analysis of SCFA predictions against blood-based clinical labs in the Arivale population. intervention.ipynb contians analysis of differential response to prebiotic and probiotic interventions in the Arivale cohort. Finally, figures.ipynb contains the necessary code to construct all figures in the manuscript.
